> Face Detection using AWS Face Rekognition. The code contains a bunch of functions which does the following :
1. Create new collection (faces/ objects)
2. Add/remove new faces
3. Creating a stream to ingest where face recognition happens
4. Fetching inputs from alexa & also sending back the recognised faces info when invoked
